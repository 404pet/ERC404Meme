# PET404: Dynamic NFT Generation with ERC404 Implementation

PET404 is an innovative project that explores the dynamic generation of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using the ERC404 standard. By leveraging ERC404, PET404 introduces a novel approach to NFT creation, allowing for native liquidity, fractionalization, and traits for each NFT PET.

## Introduction

ERC404 is an experimental standard that blends the functionalities of ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, aiming to provide a framework for dynamic NFT generation. PET404 extends ERC404 to create a dynamic ecosystem where NFTs are generated based on custom DNA, offering unique traits and characteristics for each PET NFT.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic NFT Generation**: PET404 dynamically generates NFTs based on custom DNA, resulting in unique and one-of-a-kind PET NFTs for collectors.
- **ERC404 Implementation**: Leveraging the ERC404 standard, PET404 ensures native liquidity and fractionalization, allowing to use the tokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap.
- **Modular Architecture**: PET404 utilizes the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) with different facets, enabling modular design and efficient contract management.
- **Secure Reveal Process**: The reveal process of PET NFTs is managed securely using Chainlink's Automation tools, ensuring transparency and reliability.

## How It Works

1. **DNA Generation**: Each PET NFT is assigned a unique DNA sequence, which determines its traits and characteristics.
2. **Minting**: PET NFTs are minted using the ERC404 implementation, allowing for native liquidity and fractionalization.
3. **Reveal Process**: After minting, PET NFTs remain hidden until the reveal process is initiated. Chainlink's Automation tools manage the secure reveal of PET NFTs, enhancing user engagement.
4. **Collecting and Trading**: PET NFTs can be collected, traded, and showcased within the PET404 ecosystem, offering a dynamic and interactive experience for collectors.
