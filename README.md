# ERC404Meme: Next-gen Hybrid Memecoin Standard

ERC404Meme is an opionated yet very practical reimplementation of the legacy [ERC404](https://github.com/Pandora-Labs-Org/erc404) standard, designed to address the unique challenges faced by real-world memecoin projects. This standard enhances the functionality of memecoins by integrating them with the robust features of NFTs, creating a dynamic and innovative way to interact with digital assets.

## Introduction

ERC404 combines the features of ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens). ERC404Meme expands upon this foundation by enabling the creation of generative PFP NFT collections directly tied to memecoins, thus adding significant value and utility to each token.

## Key Features

- **Generative PFP NFTs**: Each ERC404Meme token is part of a larger, generative PFP NFT collection, giving unique character and identity to memecoins.
- **Native Liquidity and Fractionalization**: ERC404Meme allows for native liquidity on platforms like Uniswap, enhancing market fluidity and accessibility.
- **Modular Architecture**: Implements the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) for flexibility and efficient contract management.
- **Secure and Transparent Processes**: Integrates Chainlink's VRF and Automation tools to manage critical processes like token generation and NFT reveals, ensuring fairness and reliability.

## How It Works

1. **Token Generation**: Each ERC404Meme token corresponds to a unique PFP NFT with specific traits.
2. **Minting and Trading**: Tokens are minted and can be traded on decentralized exchanges, providing immediate liquidity and fractional ownership.
3. **Reveal Process**: NFT traits are securely and randomly revealed using Chainlink's VRF and Automation, enhancing user engagement and trust.
4. **Dynamic Interaction**: Tokens can be used within the ERC404 ecosystem for various interactions and transactions, providing a rich, user-centric experience.
